This is a rough implementation of the paper that we decided to work on after phase-1.Though training isn't complete as it is taking a lot of time for each epoch and moreover this is a database searching model which does not completely match our final aim (which is to generate images) but somehow we utilised the existing codebase and repurpose it. 
Building upon this foundation, we drew inspiration from the Tirg model and integrated its principles into our final approach, which focused on the composition of text and image embeddings(in compositions.py final approach i.e.,phase-3).
